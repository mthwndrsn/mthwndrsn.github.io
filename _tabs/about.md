G'day! I'm Matt Anderson, an Aussie tech enthusiast with a background in management consulting, business analysis, and project management. After spending years in the corporate grind, I've decided to do something a bit different: start this blog.

### Why a Blog?

I’ve always been fascinated by technology, productivity tools, and mental models that help make life easier. You could say I’m a bit of a nerd for efficiency. I started this blog as a way to share what I’ve learned along the way – about tech, work, and life in general. This site is where I document the useful tools I’ve found, the frameworks I’ve tested, and the ideas that get me excited. Think of it as my digital garden – a place where I’m "building in public," openly sharing my thoughts and progress, mistakes and all.

### What You'll Find Here

I write about topics I enjoy and that I think others might find handy, including:

- **Tech and Tools** – From productivity apps to emerging trends, I love digging into anything that can make life a little more streamlined.
- **Frameworks and Mental Models** – Ideas and structures to help organise your thinking or make better decisions (or at least that’s the plan!).
- **Project Updates** – I like to experiment with new ideas and approaches, so I’ll be checking in here with updates and reflections on what’s worked and what’s blown up in my face.
- **Random Interesting Ideas** – Whether it’s a fresh take on an old problem or a new perspective I’ve stumbled upon, I’m all about sharing things that make you go, "Huh, never thought of it that way."

### A Bit About Me

I’m based in Australia and have a laid-back approach to both life and this blog. No jargon-filled deep dives here – I keep things practical, down-to-earth, and, most importantly, useful. When I’m not writing, I’m probably tinkering with the latest tech, hanging out with my family, or desperately trying to keep my inbox at zero.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something useful here!

Cheers,  
Matt
