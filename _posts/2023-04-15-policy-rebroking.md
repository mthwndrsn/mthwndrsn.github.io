**Solution**: Automated Re-broking of Policies  
**Tools**: Python, RPA (UiPath), OCR, CRM Integration (Salesforce)

### Introduction

Insurance brokers play a vital role in finding the best policies for their clients, often needing to re-broke policies when contracts come up for renewal. This process, known as re-broking, involves gathering quotes from multiple insurers, comparing options, and securing the best deal. However, the traditional approach is labour-intensive, involving a lot of manual data entry and communication with insurers.

In this case study, we explore how an Australian insurance brokerage firm automated the re-broking process to save time, reduce errors, and improve the overall client experience.

### Problem

The brokerage firm was facing a number of challenges in their manual re-broking process:

- **Labour-intensive**: Re-broking involved multiple steps, including manually retrieving client data, sending quote requests to insurers, and entering policy details into their CRM.
- **Slow turnaround**: It often took days to gather quotes, compare them, and get back to the client, which delayed the renewal process.
- **Risk of human error**: Manually entering client and policy information into multiple systems resulted in data inconsistencies, leading to incorrect quotes and potential compliance risks.
- **Scaling issues**: As the client base grew, the brokerage found it increasingly difficult to manage the growing number of re-broking requests.

They needed a more efficient, scalable solution that would allow them to re-broke policies quickly and accurately, while also maintaining compliance with industry regulations.

### Solution: Automated Re-broking of Policies

The company implemented an **automated re-broking solution** using **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** to manage the entire process, from data extraction to policy comparison. By integrating RPA with their **CRM system (Salesforce)**, the brokerage was able to automate repetitive tasks and streamline the re-broking workflow.

#### Process Overview

Here’s a breakdown of the automated re-broking process:

1. **Client Data Extraction (CRM)**: The RPA bot pulls client and policy data from Salesforce, identifying which policies are due for renewal and require re-broking.
2. **Quote Requests**: The bot sends automated quote requests to insurers based on the client’s policy requirements.
3. **Insurer Response Handling (OCR)**: Responses from insurers, often in PDF or email format, are captured by the bot using **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** technology to extract key information such as premium amounts, coverage limits, and terms.
4. **Data Validation**: The bot validates the received quotes to ensure completeness and correctness before entering them into the system.
5. **Comparison and Analysis**: The bot compiles the quotes into a single comparison report, allowing brokers to easily evaluate the best options.
6. **Client Proposal Generation**: Once the best policy is selected, the bot generates a proposal document to send to the client for review and approval.
7. **Policy Issuance**: Upon client approval, the bot updates the CRM with the new policy details and sends a confirmation to the insurer to bind the policy.

### Sample Code

Here’s a simplified Python code snippet that demonstrates how the bot retrieves client data from the CRM, sends quote requests, and processes the insurer responses using OCR:

```python
import requests
from ocrmypdf import ocr

# Step 1: Retrieve client data from CRM (Salesforce)
def fetch_client_data(client_id):
    response = requests.get(f'https://api.salesforce.com/client/{client_id}')
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        print(f"Failed to retrieve data for client {client_id}")
        return None

# Step 2: Send quote requests to insurers
def send_quote_requests(client_data):
    insurers = ['InsurerA', 'InsurerB', 'InsurerC']
    for insurer in insurers:
        requests.post(f'https://{insurer}.com/quote', json=client_data)
        print(f"Quote request sent to {insurer}")

# Step 3: Process insurer responses with OCR
def process_insurer_responses(pdf_path):
    ocr_result = ocr(pdf_path, 'output.pdf', force_ocr=True)
    with open('output.pdf', 'r') as processed_pdf:
        # Extract necessary details from the processed OCR result
        for line in processed_pdf:
            if "Premium" in line:
                print(f"Extracted Premium: {line}")
            elif "Coverage" in line:
                print(f"Extracted Coverage: {line}")

# Sample run
client_data = fetch_client_data(12345)
send_quote_requests(client_data)
process_insurer_responses('insurer_response.pdf')
```

This script simulates key steps in the automated re-broking process, from fetching client data from the CRM to processing insurer responses via OCR.

### Benefits Derived

The implementation of automated re-broking provided several key benefits to the insurance brokerage:

1. **Faster Turnaround**: The time to complete the re-broking process was reduced by over 50%, allowing the brokerage to handle a higher volume of policies more efficiently.
2. **Improved Accuracy**: By automating data entry and using OCR to extract information from insurer responses, the risk of human error was significantly reduced.
3. **Increased Scalability**: The brokerage could easily scale its operations to handle more clients without adding additional staff.
4. **Better Client Experience**: Clients received quotes and proposals more quickly, improving overall satisfaction and renewal rates.
5. **Enhanced Compliance**: Automation ensured that the brokerage remained compliant with industry regulations by accurately logging all interactions and policy details in the CRM.

### Conclusion

Automating the re-broking process transformed the way this insurance brokerage managed policy renewals. The implementation of RPA and OCR reduced manual effort, improved accuracy, and allowed the brokerage to deliver a faster, more reliable service to its clients. The ability to handle re-broking more efficiently gave the brokerage a competitive edge, allowing it to focus more on strategic client relationships and less on administrative tasks.

For insurance brokers facing growing workloads and the need to streamline operations, automating re-broking processes offers a scalable, error-free solution that improves efficiency and client satisfaction.
