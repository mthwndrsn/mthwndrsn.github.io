If you’ve spent any time at a wine bar or wandered into the fancier sections of your local bottle shop recently, you’ve probably heard the buzz around “natural wine.” It’s a growing trend, but for some people, it’s still shrouded in mystery. So today, I want to share why natural wine has become a favourite of mine – and why it might just become yours too.

### What Exactly *Is* Natural Wine?

Before diving into why I love it, let’s start with a quick definition. Natural wine is made with minimal intervention. It’s basically wine the way it used to be made hundreds of years ago. No added sugars, chemicals, or yeasts – just fermented grapes doing their thing. Typically, natural wine comes from organic or biodynamically grown grapes, which means no nasty pesticides or synthetic fertilisers are used either.

In a nutshell, it’s wine in its purest, least tampered-with form. Think of it as the wine world’s equivalent of "farm-to-table" food.

### The Taste of Adventure

One of the reasons I’ve fallen in love with natural wine is that it’s unpredictable. Every bottle has the potential to be wildly different from the last. You might get a fizzy red, a cloudy orange, or a tangy white that tastes like nothing you’ve ever experienced. It’s like opening a new chapter of a book each time – sometimes, it’s a page-turner, and other times, well, let’s just say it’s a little more ‘acquired.’

But for me, that’s part of the fun. Unlike mass-produced wine, where consistency is king, natural wine embraces the quirks and variations of each vineyard, season, and grape. If you’re the kind of person who enjoys discovering new, offbeat flavours, then natural wine is a bit of a treasure hunt.

### No Headaches (Literally)

Now, this might sound a bit anecdotal, but I’ve noticed that I rarely get hangovers after drinking natural wine – at least, not the same knock-you-out kind that sometimes follow a night with conventional wines. Why? It might be the lack of sulphites (which are often added to conventional wines to preserve freshness). While sulphites aren’t necessarily evil, some people are sensitive to them, and that could be why you wake up feeling like you’ve gone three rounds with a kangaroo after a few too many glasses of Shiraz.

Natural wine tends to have fewer additives, and that means fewer potential nasties for your body to deal with. Of course, moderation is key – I’m not saying natural wine is some magic hangover-free potion (if only), but it might just be kinder on your system.

### It’s Better for the Planet

We’ve all become more conscious of what we consume – whether it’s where our food comes from, how our clothes are made, or how much waste we’re producing. Natural wine fits right into that eco-friendly mindset. Organic farming practices, fewer chemicals, and sustainable viticulture make natural wine a more environmentally friendly option compared to its mass-produced counterparts.

Most natural wine producers operate on a small scale, too. This means they tend to care deeply about the land they’re working on, focusing on soil health, biodiversity, and regenerative farming practices. In a world where big corporations often dominate, it’s nice to know you’re supporting smaller, independent producers who genuinely care about what they’re doing.

### Wine With a Story

Natural wine is often made by winemakers with a strong connection to their land and a dedication to traditional methods. When you buy a bottle of natural wine, you’re often getting more than just fermented grape juice – you’re getting a story. These wines aren’t churned out by machines in a factory; they’re crafted by passionate people who love what they do.

I love knowing that each bottle has a tale behind it – whether it’s the small family-run vineyard in the south of France or the quirky winemaker experimenting with unusual grape varieties in Victoria. There’s something deeply satisfying about drinking wine that has a bit of heart and soul behind it.

### It's Not About Snobbery

One of the things I really appreciate about the natural wine movement is how inclusive it feels. There’s no pretense or snobbery, no "you must smell the hints of tobacco and leather in this 2005 vintage" nonsense (unless that’s your thing, in which case, all power to you). Instead, natural wine embraces the idea that wine should be fun, approachable, and – most importantly – enjoyable.

I’ve been to a few natural wine tastings where I was encouraged to just say whatever I tasted – whether it was strawberries, cider, or even “barnyard” (which, weirdly, can be a compliment in the natural wine world). No judgment, no wrong answers. It’s all about your personal experience with the wine.

### How to Get Started with Natural Wine

If you’re intrigued but don’t know where to start, don’t worry – I’ve been there! Here are a few tips to dip your toes into the world of natural wine:

1. **Visit a wine bar or shop that specialises in natural wines**: This is probably the easiest way to get started. Most places will let you try a few samples, and the staff are usually super knowledgeable and happy to chat about what they’ve got in stock.
  
2. **Try an orange wine**: This is one of the more distinctive styles of natural wine. It’s made from white grapes, but the skins are left on during fermentation, giving it an amber or orange hue. It can be a bit of an acquired taste, but if you’re feeling adventurous, it’s a great entry point.

3. **Ask for recommendations**: If you’ve got friends who are into natural wine, ask them for their favourite bottles. Or, if you’re buying from a local shop, don’t be shy to ask the staff what they’d recommend based on your current tastes.

4. **Start with a low-intervention wine**: Not all natural wines are completely wild in flavour. Some producers make wines that are still quite familiar in taste, just with fewer additives and less intervention.

### Final Thoughts

Natural wine isn’t for everyone, and that’s okay. But for me, it’s been a fun, tasty, and surprisingly sustainable journey into the world of wine. From the unpredictable flavours to the lack of hangovers (seriously, it’s a game-changer), natural wine has become my go-to whenever I want something a little different.

If you’ve been curious about natural wine but haven’t yet taken the plunge, I encourage you to give it a try. You might just find that you enjoy the ride as much as I do.

Cheers! 🍷
