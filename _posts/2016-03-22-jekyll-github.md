When it comes to starting a personal blog, you’ve got a smorgasbord of options—WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, Medium, Ghost—the list goes on. So, why on earth would I go with something like Jekyll, hosted on GitHub Pages? I know, it sounds like a choice only a tech geek would make, but hear me out. There’s method to the madness.

In this post, I’ll break down why I opted for this combination and why it might just be the perfect fit for someone who wants control, simplicity, and to avoid unnecessary costs.

### What is Jekyll Anyway?

In a nutshell, Jekyll is a static site generator. Unlike WordPress or Squarespace, which rely on databases to generate content dynamically every time someone visits your site, Jekyll pre-builds your site into static HTML files. No databases, no server-side scripting—just simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, sitting there ready to go.

But why does that matter? Glad you asked.

### The Speed and Simplicity of Static Sites

Static websites are **blazingly fast** compared to dynamic sites because the server doesn’t have to construct the page from scratch each time. The HTML is already there, ready to be served up. Google loves fast sites, and so do users. In fact, studies show that 53% of mobile users will abandon a website if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load.

For a personal blog like mine, that speed is a huge win. I’m not running an e-commerce site with complex transactions or real-time data, so I don’t need the overhead that comes with dynamic CMS solutions. I just need my content to load quickly and reliably. 

Also, fewer moving parts (no databases or PHP to worry about) means there are fewer things to break. Simplicity, in this case, equals peace of mind.

### Why GitHub Pages?

There’s a certain kind of satisfaction in not having to pay for hosting—and GitHub Pages offers just that. It’s **free hosting** for static sites. And when you’re working with Jekyll, the integration is seamless. I can push new content and updates directly from my Git repository, and GitHub handles the rest. No messing around with FTP, no hunting for the right web hosting plan, just pure simplicity.

If you’re someone who enjoys the idea of managing your website via a Git repository (like me), GitHub Pages is a dream come true. You just push your code, and boom—your website is live. Plus, if you ever want to dig into version control and track changes to your blog, GitHub has that built-in.

### Customisation Without the Bloat

One of the things I always struggled with when using platforms like WordPress was the bloat. Plugins, themes, and widgets can quickly slow things down or, worse, break your site when something isn’t compatible after an update. While WordPress is extremely powerful and customisable, that often comes at the cost of **speed and simplicity**.

With Jekyll, you get **full control over your site’s design and functionality**—minus the clutter. You can easily tweak the HTML, CSS, and even Ruby code that powers your blog, all without being shackled by a restrictive theme or plugin system.

I wanted my blog to feel light, clean, and quick, and Jekyll offered the perfect balance between flexibility and performance. If I need to make adjustments, I can do so directly in the code, keeping everything lean and tailored to my needs.

### It’s a Chance to Keep Learning

I’m all about continual learning, and building this blog on Jekyll and GitHub gives me an opportunity to sharpen my coding skills. Sure, I could’ve taken the easy route with something like Medium, but I’d rather be "building in public" and getting hands-on with my own site.

While Jekyll and GitHub Pages might sound a bit techy, it’s been a fun project that has stretched me beyond just writing content. Setting it up gave me an opportunity to dive deeper into web development, and let’s face it, who doesn’t love a good GitHub push?

Plus, having this kind of control means I’m not tied to any platform’s limitations. With Jekyll and GitHub, I’m free to adapt, change, or scale the site however I see fit in the future. And because everything is hosted on GitHub, I have **version control** and **backup** baked right in.

### Security: One Less Thing to Worry About

One of the hidden benefits of running a static site is that it’s inherently more secure than a dynamic one. Since there’s no backend database or user login system, there are fewer attack vectors. No databases to hack, no SQL injections to worry about—just good ol' HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

For me, that’s a big bonus. It’s one less thing to stress over. I can spend my time focusing on writing content and tinkering with my blog’s design, rather than constantly worrying about security updates, plugin vulnerabilities, or brute force attacks on login pages.

### Cost? Virtually Free

One of the most attractive aspects of using Jekyll with GitHub Pages is the **zero-dollar price tag**. As long as you’ve got a domain (which you can grab for as little as $10 a year), you’re golden. GitHub hosts the site for free, and Jekyll itself is open-source, so there are no recurring fees for fancy plugins, themes, or hosting.

Compare that to a WordPress site, where you’ll likely end up paying for hosting, premium themes, plugins, and possibly security add-ons. All that can add up fast, especially if you’re not running a business blog or generating revenue from your content. With Jekyll and GitHub Pages, I’ve cut out most of those costs, which is a huge win when you’re just getting started or keeping things simple.

### Final Thoughts: Is This Approach for Everyone?

Look, I’m not saying that Jekyll and GitHub Pages are the right solution for every blogger. If you’re after a quick, plug-and-play platform, or you’re not comfortable working with code, you might prefer something like WordPress, Squarespace, or Medium. They’re fantastic platforms in their own right, with loads of features and ease of use.

But for those who want a fast, lightweight, and highly customisable blog with minimal ongoing costs, Jekyll and GitHub Pages are hard to beat. It’s been a fun and rewarding project, and the control I have over my site makes the extra setup totally worth it.

Plus, now that it’s all set up, running this blog is practically maintenance-free. I can focus on creating content, while Jekyll and GitHub Pages handle the heavy lifting.

So, that’s why I built my blog on Jekyll and hosted it on GitHub. If you’re into clean, fast, and cost-effective blogging, it might be worth a look. You never know—it could be the perfect fit for your next project.
