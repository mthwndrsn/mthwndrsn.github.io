title: How to Write Emails with Efficiency and Clarity
---
Emails have become a core communication tool. But how often have you found yourself re-reading long, confusing emails, struggling to extract key points, or worse, getting lost in a sea of unclear instructions? The military has long honed its communication methods to be precise and effective, especially when conveying mission-critical information. Here’s how you can apply some of these techniques to make your emails more impactful and less time-consuming for everyone involved.

### 1. **Start with a Clear Subject Line**
In military communications, the subject line is designed to give a clear indication of what’s inside. Your emails should do the same. A vague subject line like “Follow-up” is not nearly as effective as “Budget Review Meeting - Next Steps.” Specific subject lines help your recipient prioritize and understand the content without opening the email. They can make a quick judgment about urgency and importance just by glancing at it.

### 2. **Use the BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front) Method**
The military employs a "BLUF" method, which means getting straight to the point at the start of the communication. In emails, this means putting the most critical information, decisions, or requests right at the top. People shouldn’t have to sift through paragraphs to know what action is required. Imagine starting your email with, “Action required: Submit expense reports by Friday” and following with details. It saves time and ensures nothing important gets buried.

### 3. **Keep It Brief and Organized**
Military orders are often terse and to the point. In email, brevity ensures that your reader doesn't get lost in unnecessary information. If your email is creeping past a couple of short paragraphs, consider how to simplify it. Avoid cramming multiple topics into a single message. If necessary, break your email into clearly marked sections or use bullet points to make scanning easier.

### 4. **Actionable Language**
In the military, ambiguity is the enemy. The same goes for email communication. Make sure you are using actionable, specific language. Instead of “Let me know your thoughts,” try “Please send your feedback on the attached report by Thursday.” You want to reduce any room for misinterpretation and make the required actions crystal clear.

### 5. **End with a Call to Action**
Wrap up your emails with a specific next step or request. Think of it as handing over the baton: what should the recipient do after reading your email? Whether it’s attending a meeting, providing feedback, or completing a task, make it explicit. A simple “Looking forward to your response by Friday” sets expectations and timelines.

### 6. **Be Considerate of the Reader's Time**
Military leaders understand that everyone is juggling multiple tasks, and the same is true in the corporate world. When writing an email, ask yourself: does the reader need to know this, or is it better suited for a follow-up or meeting? Avoid unnecessary cc’ing and don’t clutter inboxes with excessive back-and-forth. Streamlining communication respects others’ time and builds a more efficient workflow.

### 7. **Maintain a Professional Tone**
Military communications are serious, to the point, and maintain a high level of professionalism. While your emails may not always need to be formal, maintaining clarity and professionalism in your tone helps to ensure you’re taken seriously and that your message is well-received.

By applying these strategies from military communication, your emails will become far more effective, ensuring that the necessary actions are clear, your messages are respected, and everyone’s time is used wisely.
