title: "I Bet on the Wrong Horse: Starting a Business Promoting Bots (the What) Rather Than Automation (the How)"
---
Starting a business is always a learning curve, full of excitement and optimism. But sometimes, you realise that despite your best intentions, you've placed your bets on the wrong horse. This is exactly what happened to me when I ventured into promoting bots rather than focusing on the broader concept of automation. Let me share a few thoughts on how I went wrong, what I learned, and why the “how” of automation is more valuable than the shiny “what” of bots.

### The Hype Around Bots

A couple of years ago, bots were all the rage. The tech world was buzzing about chatbots, virtual assistants, and AI-driven software that could handle routine tasks without human intervention. They were shiny, exciting, and felt like the future. So, I thought, “Why not get ahead of the curve and start a business around this hot new tech?”

I wasn’t wrong to be excited. In fact, chatbots and other AI tools have since taken off. You see them everywhere: customer support pop-ups, virtual assistants in apps, and even bots that handle scheduling, order-taking, and lead generation. But here’s the thing: bots themselves are just tools. And as I found out, focusing on the tools (the *what*) rather than the broader benefits they bring (the *how*) was a mistake.

### The Misstep: Focusing on the "What"

When I started promoting bots, I pitched them as magic solutions to businesses' problems. “Get a chatbot, and your customer service issues are solved!” I'd say, or “A bot can handle all your repetitive tasks so your team can focus on real work!”

This approach worked—sort of. I got a few clients on board, and businesses were intrigued by the idea of replacing human tasks with automated bots. But here's where it fell flat: most companies didn’t just need bots. They needed *automation*. What I didn’t realise at the time was that while bots can be part of an automation strategy, they aren’t a one-size-fits-all solution. I was promoting bots for the sake of bots, not for the efficiencies and transformations that automation brings.

### The Shift to the "How"

The reality is that businesses aren’t interested in technology just for technology’s sake. They want solutions. They don’t care if it’s a bot, a script, or a cloud-based automation tool. What they care about is how automation can make their lives easier, cut down costs, and boost productivity. It’s about the process, the workflows, and the measurable improvements, not just the fancy tools.

Once I shifted my focus from bots to broader automation strategies, the conversations I had with potential clients changed. Instead of selling them on a bot that could, say, answer FAQs, I started discussing how end-to-end automation could streamline their entire customer service process. Instead of focusing on the product, I honed in on the *outcome*.

### Why the "How" Matters More

Here’s what I learned from that experience: Automation isn’t just about cool tools like bots or AI-driven software. It’s about finding the best way to get things done with the least amount of friction. 

For example:
- **Bots** can answer customer questions, but **automated workflows** can direct customer issues to the right team, trigger follow-ups, and send reminders without anyone lifting a finger.
- **Bots** can send appointment reminders, but **automation** can integrate calendars, reschedule when conflicts arise, and update systems across the board.

Automation is the engine behind efficiency. Bots are merely one of the cogs in that engine. Promoting bots without the broader context of automation is like trying to sell a car by focusing only on the gearshift. Sure, it’s a nice feature, but it’s the smooth drive that people actually care about.

### Lessons Learned (and Why You Shouldn't Bet on the Wrong Horse)

1. **Customers Value Solutions, Not Tools**  
   In business, especially in tech, there’s a tendency to get swept up in the excitement of new gadgets or software. But ultimately, what customers want is an outcome. They care about what automation *does* for them—whether it’s saving time, reducing errors, or cutting costs—not the specific tools that make it happen.

2. **The Big Picture Matters**  
   Automation isn’t just about adding a bot here or there. It’s about integrating processes across an entire business to create seamless workflows. Understanding the “how” of automation—how it improves productivity, how it reduces manual intervention, and how it can transform a business—is far more valuable than any single bot.

3. **Adapt, Evolve, and Keep Learning**  
   One of the most important lessons in business (and life) is the ability to adapt. When I realised that my bot-focused strategy wasn’t cutting it, I pivoted to focus on automation at large. And guess what? It worked. Don’t be afraid to reassess your approach and make changes when something isn’t working as well as you hoped.

### Wrapping Up: The Journey Continues

The bot craze was exciting, and I don’t regret diving in. It taught me valuable lessons about business, technology, and the importance of focusing on the big picture. The shift from promoting the “what” to embracing the “how” has made all the difference.

In the end, automation is about more than just throwing a bot at a problem and hoping for the best. It’s about crafting thoughtful, efficient workflows that help businesses run smoothly. And when you focus on that, it’s a bet that’s far more likely to pay off.

So, here’s to making better bets, learning from our missteps, and keeping the focus on what really matters: the *how*. Cheers!
