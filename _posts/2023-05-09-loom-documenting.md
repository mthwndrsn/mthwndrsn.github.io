### How to Quickly Document a Process Using Loom

In the fast-paced world of work today, documentation is crucial, but it’s also often tedious and time-consuming. The solution? **Loom**, the video messaging tool that allows you to record and share processes visually and quickly. Whether you’re explaining how to onboard a new employee, walking through a software workflow, or showing off a new feature to a client, Loom makes it easy to create detailed yet concise process documentation.

Here’s how to get started, quickly and effectively documenting processes using Loom:

---

### 1. **What is Loom?**

Loom is a screen and video recording tool designed for quick, easy communication. Think of it as recording your screen and voice in one go, making it perfect for explaining processes that involve software or visual elements.

Loom cuts down the need for long emails or written guides—sometimes a quick video walkthrough is all you need. It’s like the next best thing to being in the room together.

### 2. **Why Use Loom for Documenting Processes?**

- **Speed:** You can record a process in real-time, often faster than typing out a detailed document.
- **Clarity:** It’s easy to show *exactly* what you mean by showing people your screen and narrating the steps.
- **Efficiency:** Saves time for both the person creating the guide and the one viewing it. You get the message across without having to explain things twice.
- **Asynchronous Communication:** Looms can be shared across teams in different time zones, making it great for remote work.

### 3. **Setting Up Loom: The Basics**

To get started with Loom, you first need to install the tool:

1. **Sign Up or Log In** to Loom (they offer a free tier that’s more than enough for most process documentation needs).
2. **Download the Loom desktop app** or use their **Chrome extension**.
3. **Install Loom** following the simple on-screen instructions.
   
Once installed, Loom will let you choose between:
- **Screen + Cam**: Record both your screen and your face using your webcam (good for adding a personal touch).
- **Screen Only**: Just record your screen.
- **Cam Only**: For when you just want to record yourself explaining something without sharing your screen.

### 4. **Documenting a Process in Loom – Step-by-Step**

Here’s the fast track to documenting a process using Loom:

#### **Step 1: Plan the Process**
Before hitting record, spend a minute outlining the key steps of the process you want to document. Don’t go into full-on script mode (unless you’re that kind of person), but at least have a mental map of what you want to show.

For example, if you’re showing a colleague how to update a website:
- Step 1: Logging into the admin panel.
- Step 2: Navigating to the 'Posts' section.
- Step 3: Editing the content.

#### **Step 2: Start Recording**
Once you’re ready:
1. Open Loom.
2. Select **Screen + Cam** (or **Screen Only** if you don’t want to appear on the video).
3. Hit **Start Recording**.

Loom gives you a quick countdown before recording starts. Begin walking through the process while narrating. Don’t worry too much about perfection—Loom is meant for quick, casual documentation, not highly polished presentations.

#### **Step 3: Narrate as You Go**
As you demonstrate each step, describe what you’re doing. Remember, it’s about clarity, not over-explaining. Aim for short, simple sentences like:
- “First, go to the ‘Settings’ tab.”
- “Click ‘Save’ when you’re done.”

This is one of the biggest time-savers with Loom—explaining on the fly while you do the task.

#### **Step 4: Finish Recording and Share**
When you’re done, click **Stop Recording**. Loom automatically processes the video and gives you a shareable link in seconds. No need to download massive files or wait for lengthy uploads.

You can also:
- **Trim the video** if you made any mistakes or have dead air.
- Add a **call-to-action (CTA)** button, which is great if the video is going to external clients and you want them to take immediate action.

### 5. **Pro Tips for Better Process Documentation**

- **Keep it Short**: Aim for videos under 5 minutes unless absolutely necessary. People don’t have time for 20-minute explanations.
- **Use Highlights**: If there’s a particularly tricky part, use Loom’s timestamp comments feature to highlight it for easy reference.
- **Organise Your Looms**: If you’re documenting a series of processes, organise them into **folders** within Loom. This keeps everything accessible for your team.
- **Caption It**: If your Loom video is going to people in different regions or those who prefer to watch with sound off, add **captions** for better clarity.

### 6. **Use Cases: When to Use Loom for Process Documentation**

- **Onboarding new team members:** Quickly show them how to use software, navigate your internal systems, or complete regular tasks.
- **Client communications:** When explaining a new feature or service, it’s far more engaging than a long-winded email.
- **Team knowledge sharing:** Share how you completed a task, resolved an issue, or set up a project so others can replicate it in the future.

### 7. **Final Thoughts**

Documenting processes doesn't need to be a chore. Loom allows you to quickly and efficiently create easy-to-understand video guides. In a few minutes, you can explain a process that would take an hour to write out, and the best part is, it’s easier for others to follow. Whether you're training a team, sharing knowledge, or showing a client how something works, Loom is an excellent tool to have in your toolkit.

Give it a shot! You’ll wonder how you ever lived without it.
