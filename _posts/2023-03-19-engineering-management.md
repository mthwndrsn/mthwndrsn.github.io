If you've ever found yourself managing a software engineering team, you're probably familiar with the feeling of juggling a hundred different things at once. There's code quality, deadlines, team dynamics, unexpected bugs, stakeholder expectations, and the ever-present need to "move fast without breaking things" (as if that’s really possible all the time). As someone who transitioned from a project management and consulting background into software engineering management, I’ve learned a lot along the way—some the hard way, some from mentors, and some through a few too many late nights fixing production issues.

Here’s a look at the top learnings I’ve picked up from managing software engineering teams. Whether you're a new manager or a seasoned leader, these insights will hopefully help you navigate the unpredictable yet exciting world of engineering management.

### 1. **The Team’s Success Is Your Success (and Vice Versa)**

As a manager, you might not be the one committing code to the repo every day, but you're still accountable for the team’s output. It’s tempting to get stuck in the mindset of needing to contribute directly to the technical work (especially if you come from an engineering background). However, your primary job is to **clear roadblocks** and **create an environment where your team can thrive**.

If your team’s crushing it, that's your win. If they’re falling behind, missing deadlines, or churning out spaghetti code, that’s on you too. A good leader focuses on supporting their team, offering guidance, and ensuring everyone has the tools, clarity, and focus needed to succeed. In the end, you’re like a conductor in an orchestra—you’re not playing the instruments, but you sure as hell set the tone.

### 2. **Trust, but Verify**

One of the most important things you can do as a manager is to **trust your team**. Micromanagement is the fastest way to kill morale and stifle creativity. Engineers are generally self-driven problem solvers, and they don’t need someone looking over their shoulder 24/7. However, this doesn’t mean you should take a fully hands-off approach.

Adopt a "trust, but verify" mentality. Let your team own their work and processes, but keep regular check-ins and use metrics to monitor progress. Tools like **JIRA**, **GitHub Insights**, or **Trello** (whatever your flavour of project management) can help you see where things are without constantly nagging for updates. Focus on outcomes, not hours.

### 3. **Technical Debt is Real (and Dangerous)**

Most engineers understand the concept of **technical debt**, but it’s often underestimated how much this can cripple a team in the long run. While it's sometimes necessary to cut corners to hit deadlines, accumulating too much tech debt without addressing it can bring development to a crawl. The codebase becomes fragile, bugs appear out of nowhere, and adding new features takes way longer than it should.

As a manager, you need to be the voice that balances the business's need for speed with the technical needs for sustainability. Make time for refactoring and **paying down tech debt**. In fact, baking it into your team’s regular sprint planning can work wonders for long-term productivity.

### 4. **Not Every Engineer Wants to Be a Manager (and That’s OK)**

One of the biggest mistakes in engineering career paths is assuming that the natural next step for senior engineers is management. Some people love coding, and they’re damn good at it. Forcing them into management roles just because they’ve been around for a while can backfire.

It’s important to have clear career paths for **individual contributors (ICs)** as well as managers. ICs should feel like they can grow, take on more responsibility, and get promoted without having to manage people. This is where dual-ladder career frameworks come in handy, offering both a technical path (Senior Engineer, Principal Engineer, etc.) and a management path (Team Lead, Engineering Manager).

### 5. **Culture Eats Process for Breakfast**

You can implement all the agile processes, Kanban boards, daily standups, and sprint reviews you want. But if the **culture** in your team isn’t right, none of that will matter. A team’s culture dictates how well they communicate, collaborate, and handle adversity.

In software engineering teams, it’s especially important to foster a **blameless culture**. Bugs will happen, production will go down, and things will break. The key is not to point fingers but to learn from failures and **improve systems** so the same mistakes aren’t repeated. Postmortems should be blameless, with the focus on identifying root causes and actionable improvements rather than witch hunts.

As a manager, it’s your job to set the tone. Celebrate wins, but more importantly, use failures as opportunities to grow the team’s resilience and problem-solving capabilities.

### 6. **Hiring Well is More Important than Filling Seats Quickly**

There’s a constant pressure to deliver faster, especially in high-growth companies or when your team is understaffed. It’s tempting to rush through hiring just to get **someone, anyone** in the door. But hiring the wrong person can be a costly mistake. Not only do they slow down the team’s productivity, but cultural misfits can also create friction and tension within the group.

Take your time to find people who not only have the technical chops but also align with the team’s values and work ethic. **Diversity** is also key here; teams with a diverse range of experiences and perspectives consistently outperform homogeneous ones. In a technical environment, diversity doesn’t just mean gender or race but also cognitive diversity—different problem-solving approaches can lead to better solutions.

### 7. **Communication is Everything**

In most software teams, especially in distributed or hybrid environments, communication can make or break a project. Encourage your team to **over-communicate**, not just in terms of project updates but also when they’re stuck on a problem or need help. A one-line Slack message can save hours of frustration down the road.

However, as a manager, it’s also your job to streamline communication and ensure it’s efficient. Too many meetings can kill productivity. Try to keep meetings short, focused, and necessary. Implement async updates where possible (tools like Slack standups or Loom videos are useful), and make sure everyone has a clear idea of who’s doing what.

### 8. **Burnout is Real—Take Care of Your Team**

The tech industry is notorious for pushing engineers to their limits, often resulting in burnout. As a manager, it's your responsibility to recognise when your team is overworked and to help them manage their workload. **Sustainable pace** is not just a nice-to-have; it’s crucial for long-term success.

Regular one-on-ones can help you gauge how your team is feeling. Don’t just talk about work—ask them how they’re doing personally and if there’s anything you can do to support them. Encourage time off, and lead by example by taking breaks yourself. Burnout isn’t always immediately visible, but it can derail even the best teams.

### 9. **Adaptability is Key**

The world of software engineering is constantly changing. New frameworks, tools, and methodologies pop up seemingly every day. As a manager, you need to **stay adaptable** and open to new ideas. The way your team works today might not be the best way tomorrow.

Be willing to try new things—whether it’s adopting a new tech stack, changing your project management style, or experimenting with new ways to foster collaboration. Encourage a growth mindset within your team, where learning and continuous improvement are embedded in the culture.

### 10. **Celebrate Successes, Big and Small**

Last but not least, **celebrate the wins**. Software engineering can be a grind, and it’s easy to get lost in the endless loop of shipping features and fixing bugs. Take time to acknowledge and celebrate successes, whether it’s a successful release, squashing a tough bug, or even just getting through a particularly tough sprint.

Recognition doesn’t have to be formal—sometimes a quick shoutout in a meeting or a fun Slack emoji reaction can boost morale. Celebrating success, even the small stuff, helps build a sense of momentum and keeps the team motivated.

### Final Thoughts

Managing software engineering teams can feel like trying to steer a ship through uncharted waters. There will be calm days, and there will be storms, but with the right approach, you can guide your team to success. Remember: focus on your people, not just the process. Create an environment of trust, continuous improvement, and open communication, and you’ll see your team thrive.

And, if all else fails, just remember to stock up on coffee and snacks—because let’s be honest, sometimes that’s the only thing keeping everyone going!
