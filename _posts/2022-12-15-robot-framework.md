In today’s fast-paced world of automation and digital transformation, there’s no shortage of tools and frameworks promising to revolutionise your workflow. But finding one that actually delivers can be like looking for a needle in a haystack. One of the most versatile tools I've come across in this space is **Robot Framework**. And to take things up a notch, I've recently partnered with **Robocorp**, a company pushing the boundaries of open-source automation. 

So, what exactly is Robot Framework? And why did I decide to team up with Robocorp? Let’s dig into it.

## What is Robot Framework?

At its core, Robot Framework is an open-source automation framework primarily used for test automation and robotic process automation (RPA). It’s been around since 2008, developed initially as a test automation tool but has since grown into much more.

Here’s why Robot Framework stands out:

### 1. **Keyword-Driven Automation**
Robot Framework uses a **keyword-driven** approach, which basically means that you write your test cases or automation scripts using high-level keywords rather than writing low-level code for each test. This makes it highly readable and easy for non-programmers to contribute to automation projects. 

### 2. **Extensible with Libraries**
What makes Robot Framework so versatile is its ability to integrate with an extensive number of libraries. Whether you want to automate a web browser (using SeleniumLibrary), APIs (RESTinstance), or databases, you can find a library that fits your needs. And if you can’t, you can write your own.

### 3. **Cross-Platform**
It’s compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a highly flexible tool for teams using different operating systems.

### 4. **Great for Both Testing and RPA**
While originally a testing tool, Robot Framework is also widely used for RPA, making it a double-edged sword that can be used in both software development and business automation.

### 5. **Open Source**
The open-source nature of Robot Framework makes it accessible to everyone. It’s constantly being improved by a community of developers, which means it evolves quickly to meet the demands of modern automation.

## Why Robot Framework?

For a former management consultant like myself who’s dipped into various industries, Robot Framework is a game-changer. It allows you to automate repetitive tasks, run efficient test cases, and handle complex business processes—all without needing to reinvent the wheel. 

For someone interested in productivity hacks and efficiency, it's the perfect balance of power and simplicity. I can automate mundane tasks in a structured way, saving time and letting me focus on higher-level strategic work. Plus, the ease of using keywords means I can collaborate with team members who might not be hardcore developers.

## Enter Robocorp: Taking Automation to the Next Level

Now, let’s talk about **Robocorp**. The reason I partnered with them is simple: **they take what Robot Framework offers and amplify it**. Robocorp focuses on cloud-native, open-source RPA tools built on top of Robot Framework. They are democratizing access to automation, making it more affordable and accessible to organisations of all sizes.

### Why Robocorp?

Here’s why Robocorp is a game-changer in the RPA world:

### 1. **Cloud-Native RPA**
Traditional RPA platforms are often expensive and require hefty on-premise infrastructure. Robocorp flips this model on its head by offering cloud-native RPA solutions. This means you can run your bots from the cloud, scaling them up or down based on demand, without the headache of maintaining physical infrastructure.

### 2. **Open-Source First**
Robocorp’s tools are open-source, which aligns perfectly with Robot Framework’s ethos. This makes it easy to get started without drowning in licensing costs, and you can customise it as per your needs.

### 3. **Code-Centric Automation**
While some RPA platforms rely on drag-and-drop interfaces, Robocorp embraces a code-centric approach. This makes it much more powerful for advanced users. You can still benefit from the ease of Robot Framework’s keyword-driven development, but also dive deeper into Python if you need to.

### 4. **Flexible and Affordable Pricing**
Compared to some traditional RPA platforms that require six-figure investments, Robocorp’s pricing model is pay-as-you-go. This is crucial for businesses that want to automate but aren’t ready to commit to massive upfront costs.

### 5. **Developer-Friendly Ecosystem**
Robocorp offers several features aimed at developers, such as **Visual Studio Code extensions**, libraries for Machine Learning, and cloud orchestrators. This allows you to build, test, and deploy bots more easily in your existing development environments.

## Why I Partnered with Robocorp

As someone who’s always looking for ways to improve efficiency and stay ahead of the curve in tech, partnering with Robocorp was a no-brainer. Here’s why:

### 1. **Shared Values in Open-Source**
Both Robot Framework and Robocorp are deeply rooted in the open-source movement. I’m a big believer in **building in public**—sharing what I’ve learned, contributing back to the community, and learning from others. This ethos matches perfectly with what Robocorp is doing, especially since they’ve made cloud-based RPA more accessible to smaller players in the industry.

### 2. **Scaling Up My Automation Efforts**
With Robocorp, I can now easily scale my automation projects. Whether I’m automating test cases for a new software tool or streamlining business processes for clients, Robocorp’s cloud-native tools give me the flexibility I need to grow.

### 3. **Future-Proofing Automation**
As businesses increasingly adopt automation, having a partner like Robocorp ensures that I’m using tools designed for the future, not the past. Their focus on cloud infrastructure, affordability, and developer-friendly tools means I can stay ahead of the game without worrying about costly upgrades or limitations.

## Wrapping Up

In summary, **Robot Framework** is an exceptional tool for both test automation and RPA, offering simplicity and flexibility with its keyword-driven approach and extensive library support. Partnering with **Robocorp** takes this further by providing a cloud-native, open-source, and scalable platform to deploy automation at a larger scale. Whether you're automating simple tasks or complex workflows, this combo has the potential to save time, reduce errors, and improve overall efficiency.

If you're in the business of automation or just curious about dipping your toes into the world of RPA, I'd highly recommend checking out Robot Framework and Robocorp. Together, they’re transforming how we think about—and execute—automation.

Stay tuned for more updates on my journey with automation and Robocorp. It’s only the beginning!
